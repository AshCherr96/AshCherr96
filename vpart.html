        <h2>Vincent's Passion in Art</h2>

        <p>It should be well known by now that Vincent was very passionate about the arts. He contributed much to the art world and even donated pieces from his private collection!</p>

        <p>Vincent was the commissioner for the Indian Arts and Crafts Board, an agency within the US Department of the Interior whose mission is to "promote the economic development of American Indians and Alaska Natives through the expansion of the Indian arts and crafts market." In 1957, he and his wife, Mary Grant, donated 90 pieces from their own private collection as well as a considerable amount of money to East Los Angeles College that established the Vincent Price Art Museum. Vincent and his wife ended up donating a total of 9,000 peices to the museum and it has been valued in excess of $5 million!</p>

        <p>From 1962-1971, he worked as the art consultant for Sears-Roebuck and they offered the "Vincent Price Collection of Fine Art" which sold 50,000 art prints to the public. The artwork he commissioned to Sears consisted works from artists Rembrandt, Picasso, and Dali. Vincent was a firm believer in making art accessible to the public which is why he took advantage of the deal with Sears. Vincent also made it possible to bring Native American art to the White House for Jacqueline Kennedy's White House restoration.</p>
